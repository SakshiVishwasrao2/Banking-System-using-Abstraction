Here’s a Java project that demonstrates the concept of Abstraction. In this project, we'll implement a Banking System where different types of accounts (e.g., Savings Account, Current Account) inherit from an abstract class Account. The abstract class will provide a general structure, and the specific details will be implemented by the child classes.
Explanation:

1. Abstraction through Abstract Class:

Account is an abstract class that defines common properties (accountHolderName, accountNumber, balance) and methods (deposit, withdraw) for different types of accounts.

The deposit and withdraw methods are abstract, meaning they don’t have implementations in the Account class. These methods must be implemented by the subclasses (SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount).



2. Concrete Classes:

SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount are concrete classes that provide the specific implementation for deposit and withdraw.

SavingsAccount also includes a method for calculating interest, while CurrentAccount manages an overdraft limit.



3. Method Usage:

In the BankManagementSystem class, we create instances of SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount and perform operations like deposit, withdrawal, and interest calculation.




Output:

Savings Account Details:
Account Holder: Alice
Account Number: SAV123
Balance: $1000.0
Deposited $500.0 into Savings Account. New Balance: $1500.0
Withdrew $200.0 from Savings Account. New Balance: $1300.0
Interest Earned: $45.5

Current Account Details:
Account Holder: Bob
Account Number: CUR456
Balance: $1500.0
Deposited $400.0 into Current Account. New Balance: $1900.0
Withdrew $1800.0 from Current Account. New Balance: $100.0

How the project works:

SavingsAccount shows how interest is calculated in addition to deposit/withdrawal operations.

CurrentAccount allows overdrawing up to a certain limit.


This project demonstrates the power of abstraction, where the abstract class Account provides a blueprint for concrete classes (SavingsAccount, CurrentAccount), enforcing certain behaviors while allowing implementation details to vary between account types.
